# DripDAOv2: Now on Goerli!

### This dApp lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by a governance contract

This project created a DAO through:
- deploying a custom ERC-20 token
- deploying a ERC-1155 NFT users can mint to join the DAO
- deploying a governance contract + treasury

It is was nice to take a trip down memeory lane and revive my first deployed dApp.

***_Notice:_*** Again, this app is not on mainnet so please connect to Goerli!
